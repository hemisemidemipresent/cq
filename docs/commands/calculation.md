# Calculation commands

These commands are the real meat of the features, and there are so many of them.

> remember to add a `q!` before every command! only command names are shown

## bank

just run q!bank, there is an automated system.

## cash

q!cash &lt;`cashNeeded`> &lt;`startRound`>

example:

```
q!cash 69420 5
```

this shows the round you can get `cashNeeded` if you start popping bloons in `startRound`

## chincome

q!chincome &lt;`round`> [`gamemode`] (Order doesn't matter)

example:

```
q!chincome 69 abr
```

-   Cash generated from start of round 6 through end of round `round`
-   Cash generated from start of round `round` through end of round 100
