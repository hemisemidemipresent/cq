# Introduction

Cyber Quincy has many, many features. There are many command categories, so feel free to browse through them

> all the inputs are case-insensitive

## How To Read

a command starts with a prefix `q!` followed immediately by a `command name`, then a space, then all the `arguments`, a bit like this:

```
{prefix}{commandname} {argument 1} {argument 2}
       q!income            9            39
```

all the commands you see is the **raw command name**.

> when you see **&lt;> and []**, **do not type "`<`", "`>`", "`[`", "`]`" literally!!!**

-   **&lt;`argumentName`>** means that `argumentName` is **compulsory**

-   **[`argumentName`]** means that `argumentName` is **optional**

## Example:

### monkeyopolis

q!monkeyopolis &lt;total farm cost> &lt;total farm amount>

example:

```
q!monkeyopolis 69420 4
```
